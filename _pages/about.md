I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Nomura Research Institute](https://www.nri.com/en) Indonesia, with over three years of experience in AI/ML research and engineering. Previously, I worked as an AI Engineer at [Qlue](https://www.qlue.ai/). My work mainly focused on developing computer vision solutions, and more recently, I have been exploring large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solutions.

I graduated from Biomedical Engineering at the School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics at Institut Teknologi Bandung. For my thesis, I worked on diabetic retinopathy severity classification using a deep learning model, supervised by Professor [Astri Handayani](https://scholar.google.co.id/citations?user=vqIAxCsAAAAJ) and Professor [Tati Latifah Erawati Rajab Mengko](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e4YcqngAAAAJ). After graduation, I continued this research as a research assistant. Previously, I also worked as a research assistant at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, focusing on optical sensor.

In June 2024, I was awarded the fully funded [Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP)](https://lpdp.kemenkeu.go.id/en/) scholarship to pursue a masterâ€™s degree abroad. I will be applying for programs starting in fall 2025. Here is my [CV](https://shidqiet.github.io/files/CV%20-%20Shidqie%20Taufiqurrahman.pdf).
