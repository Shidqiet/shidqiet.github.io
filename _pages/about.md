Hello! I am Shidqie, currently working as an ML Engineer at Nomura Research Institute Indonesia. I will soon be applying for a master's program for Fall 2025. Here is my [CV](https://shidqiet.github.io/files/CV%20-%20Shidqie%20Taufiqurrahman.pdf).

I earned my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Bandung Institute of Technology in 2020. During my studies, I worked on diabetic retinopathy severity classification using deep learning.
